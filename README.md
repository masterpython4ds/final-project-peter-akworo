# Congratulations you have reached the end of the rope! Almost :)
We hope you had fun analyzing, vizualizing and creating machine learning models.

For the final project you are required to pick a dataset of your choosing from any data source and build a machine learning model using the project description.

Here are a couple of links you can get datasets from (or if you would like you can re-use any of the datasets from the slack datasets channel)
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions)
- [Datadriven](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/)
- [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions)

### At the end of this assignment you will be required to upload a notebook with the data challenge (as per below) before you proceed to the next assignment.

We also advise you to write a technical blog on your experience (if you would like us to future your articles on the NWiMLDS page please feel free to reach out) here are a couple of great blogs you can check out for ideas:
On another note, please really consider writing your technical experience as this will gain you lots of exposure in the long run and get you noticed as well (We don't want this hard work and commitment go to waste)
